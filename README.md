# VORA Project 🎤🤖  
**Voice Oriented Response Assistant**

VORA is a smart, voice-based assistant designed to interact with users through natural speech. It listens to voice commands, processes them using AI, and provides intelligent responses or actions — bringing conversational automation to life.

## 🧠 What It Does

- 🎙️ Accepts voice input from users  
- 🧾 Converts speech to text using a speech recognition engine  
- 🧠 Processes the command with the help of **OpenAI** (for context understanding and response generation)  
- 🔁 Responds back using text-to-speech  
- 💬 Acts as a simple voice-driven chatbot or virtual assistant

## 🛠 Tech Stack

- **Python** – Core language  
- **SpeechRecognition** – For capturing and converting voice to text  
- **OpenAI API** – For natural language understanding and response  
- **pyttsx3 / gTTS** – Text-to-speech conversion  
- **Flask (Optional)** – If web-based interface is added

## 🖥️ How It Works

1. User speaks into the mic  
2. Speech is converted to text  
3. Text is sent to OpenAI for generating a contextual reply  
4. Response is converted back to voice and played to the user
